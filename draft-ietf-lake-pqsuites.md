--- abstract

The Lightweight Authenticated Key Exchange (LAKE) protocol, also known as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman over COSE (EDHOC), currently relies on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for key exchange and authentication. While well-suited for constrained environments, existing cipher suites do not provide post-quantum security. This document specifies how the LAKE protocol operates in a post-quantum setting and can achieve post-quantum security by adding new cipher suites with quantum-resistant algorithms, such as ML-DSA for digital signatures and ML-KEM for key exchange. These new cipher suites are compatible with signature-based authentication (Method 0) and with the PSK-based authentication method defined in {{I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc-psk}}, and require no modification to the LAKE protocol itself. This document also specifies the use of Post-Quantum KEM (PQ-KEM), as defined in {{I-D.ietf-jose-pqc-kem}}, as a post-quantum replacement for the ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange, with the KEM ciphertext and encapsulated key carried in the G_X and G_Y fields of message_1 and message_2, and specifies the use of ML-DSA for post-quantum signature-based authentication. As PQ-KEM constructions are, in general, not Diffie-Hellman / Non-Interactive Key Exchange (DH/NIKE) primitives, this document updates the LAKE Method Type and Cipher Suites registries to indicate DH/NIKE requirements and support. New cipher suites combining ML-KEM and ML-DSA are registered accordingly. Furthermore, this document discusses security considerations for these cipher suites.

# Introduction

The Lightweight Authenticated Key Exchange (LAKE) protocol defined in {{RFC9528}}, also known as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman over COSE (EDHOC), supports the use of multiple authentication methods and the negotiation of cipher suites based on COSE algorithms. Currently, four asymmetric authentication methods (0, 1, 2, and 3) are defined. In addition, a symmetric key-based authentication method, for session resumption through a PSK mode, is being developed, see {{I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc-psk}}.

Currently defined cipher suites rely on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for key exchange and authentication, making them vulnerable in the event that a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC) is constructed.

This document specifies how the LAKE protocol can operate in a post-quantum setting using both signature-based and PSK-based authentication. It defines corresponding cipher suites combining ML-KEM on COSE {{I-D.ietf-jose-pqc-kem}} for key exchange and ML-DSA on COSE {{I-D.ietf-cose-dilithium}} for authentication. With this modification the protocol is no longer dependent on Diffie-Hellman which makes EDHOC a misnomer and we henceforth use the name LAKE for the protocol.


Moreover, as PQ-KEM constructions are, in general, not Diffie-Hellman / Non-Interactive Key Exchange (DH/NIKE) primitive, this document updates the LAKE Method Type registry to indicate whether a given method requires DH/NIKE, and the LAKE Cipher Suites registry to indicate whether a cipher suite supports DH/NIKE-based key exchange, see {{method-update}} and {{suites-registry}}. New cipher suites combining ML-KEM and ML-DSA are registered accordingly.


## Terminology # {#terminology}

{::boilerplate bcp14}

Readers are expected to be familiar with {{RFC9528}}. To avoid misunderstanding of the capabilities of the protocol, the name EDHOC is replaced by LAKE. To avoid misunderstanding with terminology from {{RFC9528}}, the prefix EDHOC is retained when needed, for example in the IANA registries.


# LAKE with Quantum-Resistant Algorithms

Method 0 in {{RFC9528}}, which uses digital signatures for authentication by both the Initiator and Responder, and also the PSK method in {{I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc-psk}}, is straightforward to use with standardized post-quantum algorithms.

A quantum-resistant signature algorithm, such as ML-DSA {{I-D.ietf-cose-dilithium}}, is a drop-in replacement for classical signature algorithms such as ECDSA. For post-quantum secure key exchange, a quantum-resistant Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM), such as ML-KEM {{I-D.ietf-jose-pqc-kem}}, can be applied directly to the LAKE protocol, as is detailed in {{KEM}}.

To enable post-quantum security support for LAKE it suffices to register new cipher suites using COSE registered algorithms. Cipher suites using ML-KEM-512 {{I-D.ietf-jose-pqc-kem}} for key exchange and ML-DSA-44 {{I-D.ietf-cose-dilithium}} for digital signatures are specified in {{suites-registry}}. As both ML-KEM {{FIPS203}} and ML-DSA {{FIPS204}} internally use SHAKE256, it was natural to also use SHAKE256 for key derivation. Additional post-quantum cipher suites may be specified.

Methods 1–3 in {{RFC9528}} use a Diffie-Hellman/Non-Interactive Key Exchange (NIKE) based API for authentication. As of this writing, no standardized post-quantum algorithms for these methods exist. To highlight which methods that require DH/NIKE a column is added to the EDHOC Method Type registry, see {{method-update}}. To highlight matching cipher suites a corresponding column indicating support for DH/NIKE is added, see {{suites-registry}}.

An alternative path to post-quantum support for the LAKE protocol, not pursued in this document, is to define new authentication methods based on Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs).

Compared to elliptic curve algorithms such as ECDHE, ECDSA, and EdDSA, ML-KEM-512 and ML-DSA-44 introduce significantly higher overhead {{FIPS203}}{{FIPS204}}. More efficient post-quantum signature schemes are being standardized, such as FN-DSA.

# Using KEMs in the Key Exchange {#KEM}

Given a quantum-resistant KEM, such as ML-KEM-512, with encapsulation key ek, ciphertext c, and shared secret key K (using the notation of {{FIPS203}}). The Diffie-Hellman procedure in the key exchange is replaced by a KEM procedure as follows:

* The Initiator generates a new encapsulation / decapsulation key pair matching the selected cipher suite.

* The encapsulation key ek is transported in the G_X field in message_1.

* The Responder calculates (K,c) = Encaps(ek).

* The ciphertext c is transported in the G_Y field in message_2.

* The Initiator calculates the shared secret K = Decaps(c).

* G_XY is the shared secret key K.

The security requirements and security considerations of {{RFC9528}} and the KEM algorithm used apply. For example, the Initiator MUST generate a new encapsulation / decapsulation key pair for LAKE session.

Note that G_Y does not contain a public key when a KEM is used in this way. The definition of LAKE message_2 in {{Section 5.3.1 of RFC9528}} remains the same:

~~~~~~~~~~~ CDDL
message_2 = (
  G_Y_CIPHERTEXT_2 : bstr,
)
~~~~~~~~~~~

and G_Y_CIPHERTEXT_2 remains the concatenation of G_Y and CIPHERTEXT_2, the latter is defined in {{Section 5.3.2 of RFC9528}}. But now G_Y is a KEM ciphertext.

Just as with the ephemeral key G_Y, the length of KEM ciphertext G_Y is known from the corresponding algorithm in the selected cipher suite, see {{fig-ct-length}}. Hence the Initator can separate out the concatenated ciphertexts and decapsulate and decrypt, respectively.

~~~~~~~~~~~

Note also that this use of KEM applies both to standalone KEM and hybrid KEMs such as, e.g., X-wing {{I-D.connolly-cfrg-xwing-kem}}.

Conventions for using post-quantum KEMs within COSE are described in {{I-D.ietf-jose-pqc-kem}}. The shared secret key K corresponds to the initial shared secret SS' in that document.

# Security Considerations

The cipher suites defined in {{RFC9528}} rely on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for key exchange and authentication, which would be broken by a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC). In contrast, the cipher suites specified in this document use the quantum-resistant algorithms ML-KEM for key exchange and ML-DSA for authentication. When used with Method 0 from {{RFC9528}}, where both the Initiator and Responder authenticate using digital signatures, or with the PSK method defined in {{I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc-psk}}, these cipher suites preserve the same security properties even in the presence of a quantum-capable adversary.

Security considerations of ML-KEM are discussed in {{I-D.sfluhrer-cfrg-ml-kem-security-considerations}}.

# IANA Considerations

## EDHOC Method Type Registry {#method-update}

IANA is requested to update the EDHOC Method Type registry with a column with heading "Requires DH/NIKE" indicating that the method requires Diffie-Hellman or Non-Interactive Key Exchange. Valid table entries in this column are "Yes" and "No".

For the existing Method Types, the following entries are inserted in the new "Requires DH/NIKE" column:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Value: 0, Requires DH/NIKE: No
Value: 1, Requires DH/NIKE: Yes
Value: 2, Requires DH/NIKE: Yes
Value: 3, Requires DH/NIKE: Yes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## EDHOC Cipher Suites Registry {#suites-registry}

IANA is requested to update the EDHOC Cipher Suites registry with a column with heading "Supports DH/NIKE" indicating that the cipher suite supports Diffie-Hellman or Non-Interactive Key Exchange. Valid table entries in this column are "Yes" and "No".

For the existing cipher suites 0-6, 24, 25, the entry "Yes" is inserted in the new "Supports DH/NIKE" column.
