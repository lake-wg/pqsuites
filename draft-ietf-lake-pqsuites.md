--- abstract

The Lightweight Authenticated Key Exchange (LAKE) protocol, also known as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman over COSE (EDHOC), achieves post-quantum security by adding new cipher suites with quantum-resistant algorithms, such as ML-DSA for digital signatures and ML-KEM for key exchange. This document specifies how the LAKE protocol operates in a post-quantum setting using both signature-based and PSK-based authentication methods, and defines corresponding cipher suites.

# Introduction

The Lightweight Authenticated Key Exchange (LAKE) protocol defined in {{RFC9528}}, also known as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman over COSE (EDHOC), supports the use of multiple authentication methods and the negotiation of cipher suites based on COSE algorithms. Currently, four asymmetric authentication methods (0, 1, 2, and 3) are defined. In addition, a symmetric key-based authentication method is being developed, see {{I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc-psk}}.

Currently defined cipher suites rely on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for key exchange and authentication, making them vulnerable in the event that a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC) is constructed.

This document specifies how the LAKE protocol can operate in a post-quantum setting using both signature-based and PSK-based authentication, and defines corresponding cipher suites. With this modification the protocol is no longer dependent on Diffie-Hellman which makes EDHOC a misnomer and we henceforth use the name LAKE for the protocol.

## Terminology # {#terminology}

{::boilerplate bcp14}

Readers are expected to be familiar with {{RFC9528}}. To avoid misunderstanding of the capabilities of the protocol, the name EDHOC is replaced by LAKE. To avoid misunderstanding with terminology from {{RFC9528}}, the prefix EDHOC is retained when needed, for example in the IANA registries.


# LAKE with Quantum-Resistant Algorithms

Method 0 in {{RFC9528}}, which uses digital signatures for authentication by both the Initiator and Responder, and also the PSK method in {{I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc-psk}}, is straightforward to use with standardized post-quantum algorithms.

A quantum-resistant signature algorithm, such as ML-DSA {{I-D.ietf-cose-dilithium}}, is a drop-in replacement for classical signature algorithms such as ECDSA. For post-quantum secure key exchange, a quantum-resistant Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM), such as ML-KEM {{I-D.ietf-jose-pqc-kem}}, can be applied directly to the LAKE protocol, as is detailed in {{KEM}}, in order to replace the Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

To enable post-quantum security support for LAKE it suffices to register new cipher suites using COSE registered algorithms. Cipher suites using ML-KEM-512 and ML-KEM-1024 {{I-D.ietf-jose-pqc-kem}} for key exchange, and ML-DSA-44 and ML-DSA-87 {{I-D.ietf-cose-dilithium}} for digital signatures are specified in {{suites-registry}}. As both ML-KEM {{FIPS203}} and ML-DSA {{FIPS204}} internally use SHAKE256 {{FIPS202}}, it was natural to also use SHAKE256 for key derivation. Additional post-quantum cipher suites may be specified.

However, note that for application-layer use, e.g., with EDHOC_exporter, the use of SHA-256 or SHA-384 provides sufficient security against quantum pre-image attacks, offering 128-bit (or 192-bit) security levels, see {{suites-registry}}.

Methods 1–3 in {{RFC9528}} use a Diffie-Hellman/Non-Interactive Key Exchange (NIKE) based API for authentication. As of this writing, no standardized post-quantum algorithms for these methods exist. To highlight which methods that require DH/NIKE a column is added to the EDHOC Method Type registry, see {{method-update}}. To highlight matching cipher suites a corresponding column indicating support for DH/NIKE is added, see {{suites-registry}}.

An alternative path to post-quantum support for the LAKE protocol, not pursued in this document, is to define new authentication methods based on Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs).

Compared to elliptic curve algorithms such as ECDHE, ECDSA, and EdDSA, ML-KEM-512 and ML-DSA-44 (and ML-KEM-1024 and ML-DSA-87) introduce significantly higher overhead {{FIPS203}}{{FIPS204}} (but currently are the most effective and the lightest standardized post-quantum algorithms to implement on LAKE). More efficient post-quantum signature schemes are being standardized, such as FN-DSA which could offer smaller signatures. This remains a possible direction for future work and could lead to the definition of new cipher suites.

However, it is important to note that the post-quantum counterpart implies that these cipher suites may not be usable for certain Class of Constrained Devices (e.g., Class 0/C0) due to the technical characteristics of KEM and Signatures (key and message sizes).

# Using KEMs in the Key Exchange {#KEM}

Given a quantum-resistant KEM, such as ML-KEM-512, with encapsulation public key epk, decapsulation private key dpk, ciphertext c, and shared secret key K (using the notation of {{FIPS203}}), the Diffie-Hellman procedure in the key exchange is replaced by a KEM procedure as follows:


* The Initiator generates a new encapsulation / decapsulation key pair matching the selected cipher suite.

* The encapsulation key epk is transported in the G_X field in message_1.

* The Responder calculates (K,c) = Encaps(epk).

* The ciphertext c is transported in the G_Y field in message_2.

* The Initiator calculates the shared secret K = Decaps(dpk, c).

* G_XY is the shared secret key K.

The security requirements and security considerations of {{RFC9528}} and the KEM algorithm used apply. For example, the Initiator MUST generate a new encapsulation / decapsulation key pair for each LAKE session.

Note that G_Y does not contain a public key when a KEM is used in this way. The definition of LAKE message_2 in {{Section 5.3.1 of RFC9528}} remains the same:

~~~~~~~~~~~ CDDL
message_2 = (
  G_Y_CIPHERTEXT_2 : bstr,
)
~~~~~~~~~~~

and G_Y_CIPHERTEXT_2 remains the concatenation of G_Y and CIPHERTEXT_2, the latter is defined in {{Section 5.3.2 of RFC9528}}. But now G_Y is a KEM ciphertext.

Just as with the ephemeral key G_Y, the length of KEM ciphertext c is known from the corresponding algorithm in the selected cipher suite, see {{fig-ct-length}}. Hence the Initator can separate out the concatenated ciphertexts and decapsulate and decrypt, respectively.

The same applies to the length of the encapsulation key pek (whose size differs from that of the usual ephemeral key G_X). Upon receiving the message message_1, the Responder must first analyze the SUITES_I element to determine which KEM wants to be used by the Initiator, and then be able to correctly parse the rest of the message according to the length of the public encapsulation key.

Also note that the size of signatures exchanged in messages message_2 and message_3 of LAKE Method 0 also differs in this situation.

Note also that this use of KEM applies both to standalone KEM and hybrid KEMs such as, e.g., X-wing {{I-D.connolly-cfrg-xwing-kem}}.

Conventions for using post-quantum KEMs within COSE are described in {{I-D.ietf-jose-pqc-kem}}. The shared secret key K corresponds to the initial shared secret SS' in that document.

# Security Considerations

The cipher suites defined in {{RFC9528}} rely on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for key exchange and authentication, which would be broken by a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC). In this section we discuss the security considerations brought by the new cipher suites.

## Usual LAKE security properties

When used with Method 0 from {{RFC9528}}, where both the Initiator and Responder authenticate using digital signatures, or with the PSK method defined in {{I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc-psk}}, these cipher suites preserve the security properties discussed in {{Section 9 of RFC9528}} (for Method 0) and in {{Section 9 of I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc-psk}} (for PSK method). Let us cite, for example, mutual authentication and confidentiality, keys security, identity protection, External Authorization Data (EAD) security, etc.

This is because the security properties of LAKE (methods 0 and PSK) are affected by cipher suites only through the security of the algorithms involved. Since the algorithms introduced in these cipher suites -- ML-KEM, ML-DSA and SHAKE256 -- are post-quantum secure, i.e., secure against a quantum adversary and, by extension, secure against a classical adversary, the security properties are guaranteed.

# Privacy Considerations

TBD

# IANA Considerations

This section specifies IANA updates for LAKE Methods and Cipher Suites registration.

## LAKE Method Type Registry {#method-update}

IANA is requested to update the LAKE Method Type registry with a column with heading "Requires DH/NIKE" indicating that the method requires Diffie-Hellman or Non-Interactive Key Exchange. Valid table entries in this column are "Yes" and "No".

For the existing Method Types, the following entries are inserted in the new "Requires DH/NIKE" column:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Value: 0, Requires DH/NIKE: No
Value: 1, Requires DH/NIKE: Yes
Value: 2, Requires DH/NIKE: Yes
Value: 3, Requires DH/NIKE: Yes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This note is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.
Once the LAKE PSK authentication method {{I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc-psk}} is standardized and registered with IANA, add the line:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Value: 4, Requires DH/NIKE: No
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## LAKE Cipher Suites Registry {#suites-registry}

IANA is requested to update the LAKE Cipher Suites registry with a column with heading "Supports DH/NIKE" indicating that the cipher suite supports Diffie-Hellman or Non-Interactive Key Exchange. Valid table entries in this column are "Yes" and "No".

For the existing Cipher Suites 0-6, 24, 25, the entry "Yes" is inserted in the new "Supports DH/NIKE" column.

Furthermore, following Table 6 of {{RFC9528}}, IANA is requested to register the following entries in the LAKE Cipher Suites Registry:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Value: TBD1
Array: 30, -45, 16, TBD10, -48, 10, -16
Description: AES-CCM-16-128-128, SHAKE256, 16, MLKEM512, ML-DSA-44,
             AES-CCM-16-64-128, SHA-256

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Value: TBD3
Array: 3, -43, 16, TBD12, -48, 3, -43

Reference: [[This document]]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cipher suite TBD3 is intended for for high security applications such as government use and financial applications. This cipher suites consists of algorithms from the Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) 2.0 suite {{CNSA20}}.

The first two proposals have Category 1 security level (according to NIST), while proposal 3 is in Category 5.
